 building a image classifier using Tensorflow.js (a javascript library) 

Learning how to build a custom image classifier that you will train on the fly in the browser using TensorFlow.js.

Using transfer learning to make create a highly accurate model with minimal training data. I will be using a pre-trained model for image classification called MobileNet and training a model on top of this one to customize the image classes it recognizes.

This tutorial is presented as a codelab.
